# SSD300-Insulator-Inspector

Implementation of Single-Shot Multibox Detector 300 for detecting defects on powerline insulators. Based on [sgrvinod's A PyTorch Tutorial to Object Detection](https://github.com/sgrvinod/a-PyTorch-Tutorial-to-Object-Detection). Data taken from IEEE's Insulator Defect Detection Competition. Rationale for starting the project - instead of reading about CV, I wanted to learn CV through directly implementing an existing model.
